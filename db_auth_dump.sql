Disco Holo Square Cut Test Prints also have sharp, square corners, unlike standard issue 1999 Base Set cards.\r\n\r\nVery little was known about Disco Holo cards until June 2022, when CGC authenticated Disco Holo uncut sheets and cards for the first time.

This proves that the card stock and ink used in the production of a regular ''99 Base Set card are the same as that used to produce the Disco Holo uncut test print sheets.

I saved it because I “thought it might be worth something someday,” and it turns out I was right. Well, depending on which version you have.\r\n\r\nHere is a gradient scale on which of the old school Charizard cards are the most and least valuable. Exact figures for selling prices are hard to pin down. The low end might be a few hundred, the higher end for the rarest Charizard editions can be tens of thousands, if not over $100K for true perfection. The prices below are estimates and again, it’s a wide range. If yours isn’t here at all, it may be too common to be worth all that much.

For reference, players started with 1000 points and you would only get either 50 or 100 points for attending events and having matches. Additional points could be earned by placing in tournaments.

You might be getting back into the hobby after an extended break, or perhaps this is your first time getting into Pokémon! Whether you picked up an Elite Trainer Box in a Walmart on a whim, were fed a cool Pokémon video on YouTube, or saw an article about how Pokémon cards are "stonks," welcome (back) to the hobby! There''s no going back now.\r\n\r\nToday, I want to share with you some of the wisdom I have accumulated over my many years in the hobby, from the time I was a kid, to when I was a pimply teenager, to now when I am a less-pimply adult. It''s really easy to spend (and waste, speaking from personal experience) a lot of money in this hobby, and regardless of your budget, it''s important to collect the right way for you to maximize both your enjoyment of the cards you collect, and the money that you decide to spend.\r\n\r\nLet Go of FOMO (Wait Before You Buy)\r\nFirst, I want to give a warning about FOMO (the Fear Of Missing Out). In a hobby that revolves around collecting, it runs rampant. This is natural. The Pokémon Company releases four main sets per year, with an additional one to three special sets, on top of unique one-off products and promos. That means a new set is coming out around every two months, with more items in between. And that''s just English. If you start getting into Japanese cards, things get even more hectic, especially with the number of (admittedly very cool) Japanese-exclusive promos that are released.\r\n\r\nWhen products first come out, it''s easy to convince yourself that you want—no need—them, and that you need them now. Because they''re so cool, they''ll surely only get more expensive. In reality, this is rarely the case. While some items do get more expensive after release, if you were to take the average of all new releases, you would be better off waiting a few weeks to months after something comes out to purchase it.\r\n\r\nThis also has the added benefit of helping weed out the products you really want from the ones you''re just seeing all the time. The mere exposure effect dictates that people tend to have a preference for things that they encounter often. When the hype around a new set dies down, it''s easier to tell if we really like something or not. As someone who is very into clothing and fashion but has a New York-sized closet, I try to avoid buying items the first time I see them. If I''m still thinking about an item a week or a month later, I''ll go back and buy it. The same concept can be applied to cards! While it doesn''t need to be a hard and fast rule, strategies like waiting can help curb impulse purchases.\r\n\r\nExplore the Hobby\r\nGetting into anything new is always exciting, and it''s the best time to explore as many parts of the Pokémon card hobby as possible to determine what you really like. You may discover you love vintage cards, or modern promos, or realize you''re someone who just wants to play the TCG.\r\n\r\nIt may feel overwhelming when you first get started, so I''d recommend the following:\r\n\r\nEngage with the community. This can be on Instagram or other social media platforms, or if you can, your local card shop. It''s a great way to learn more, find cool cards, and make friends in the hobby.\r\n\r\nFind your favorite YouTubers. YouTube is a big part of the Pokémon space. Popular ones include PokeRev, UnlistedLeaf, Deep Pocket Monster, TwicebakedJake, Danny Phantump, and many more. (Shameless self-promo, but I also make YouTube videos on my channel, Eva''s Binder.)\r\n\r\nLearn as much about the history of the TCG as possible. By this, I don''t mean you need to know what year each and every set came out and all the lore surrounding them. But it''s helpful to have a general understanding of the different eras, or at least know they exist so you can figure out if you like any of them more than the others.\r\n\r\nNarrow Your Focus\r\nI know far too many people who complain about having a lot of cards they don''t actually want or feeling like their collection isn''t really a "collection," but rather a random assortment of cards. This is due to a combination of factors, but assuming you''ve avoided the trap of FOMO, the two most prevalent causes are:\r\n\r\nRipping Packs. Ripping packs may be very fun and feed your inner degenerate, but it''s certainly not the best way to get the cards you want. Not only is it not cost-effective, but you''ll also end up with a lot of cards you don''t really want, whether those are just bulk commons and uncommons, or even hits aside from the ones you''re chasing.\r\nBuying Anything and Everything. There are a lot of amazing cards. More than any one person could ever collect. The sad reality of a Pokémon collector is that you can''t have everything, no matter how much money you may have.\r\nNow that you''ve hopefully explored the hobby and at least know your options, it''ll be a lot easier to narrow down your focus. Some popular ones are:\r\n\r\nSpecies Collecting. This is the category I personally fall into. I collect Entei, along with the other Legendary dogs, Raikou and Suicune. My ultimate goal is to have every printing of Entei in a PSA 10. I''m guessing you know quite a few species collectors, since anyone who collects Charizard cards would qualify. Other popular Pokémon include Pikachu, Mewtwo, Rayquaza, and a slew of others. This can be an especially budget-friendly option if you collect a less popular Pokémon.\r\n\r\nMaster Set Collecting. Many people like to assemble a binder of every card in a given set, which is called a "master set." This can be a good option if you want to rip packs occasionally and still want it to make sense with your collecting goals. Particularly if you''re master setting new sets, you can rip a box or two to get all of the commons and uncommons, and fill in the gaps through buying and trading. However, you can also collect master sets of vintage sets like Base Set for surprisingly cheap.\r\n\r\nEra Collecting. Some people like to target specific eras, such as WotC holos, which were the earliest English cards, or e-Cards, which were released from 2002-2004. Others prefer more recent eras, like the Sun & Moon Series, or the Sword & Shield Series.\r\n\r\nGimmick Collecting. "Gimmick" is such a dirty word, but I say it with love. When I say gimmick, I''m referring to certain card types that were produced for a limited number of sets. Many of these are actually some of the most expensive set cards in the hobby, such as Shining cards, Gold Star cards, Crystal cards, etc. I think this is a great aspirational goal once you''ve been in the hobby for a little while and are sure you''re committed. However, the older subsets of cards can be quite pricey, so aren''t always accessible to new collectors. Others, like Legend cards (which were two-part cards with gorgeous art), Prime cards, and EX cards are a lot more affordable.\r\n\r\nSealed Collecting. Some people prefer to collect sealed Pokémon products. If you''re first getting into the hobby, that may sound silly, but sealed products make for great display pieces as well.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the popular strategies, but there are many more options! None of these are meant to box you in. Rather, having a directed goal that''s challenging but achievable can make collecting more rewarding, and help curb spending.\r\n\r\nInvest in Protection for Your Cards\r\nIn terms of protection, you don''t need to spend a lot, but you definitely should get a few of the basics. A good $20 binder can save you hundreds or more depending on what cards you''re putting inside. My childhood cards are crying in the corner with their creases and dirt. I recommend getting a side-loading binder, because when it inevitably ends up upside down at some point, the cards won''t be falling out the top. While there are many high-end binders out there, I typically just opt for the Ultra PRO binders. They have lots of cute designs, including a lot of official Pokémon ones, and are reasonably priced at around $15-25 at most retailers.\r\n\r\nAside from a binder, you will definitely want some sleeves. Ultra PRO makes great sleeves, but honestly for the most part I stick to penny sleeves, which as the name suggests, cost one cent. Although it may be 2.25 cents nowadays. Curse you, inflation. Putting cards in a binder alone isn''t enough to fully protect them, as they can slide around inside which can cause wear to the edges and minor scratching on the surface. I actually like penny sleeves more because they''re very clear, easy to put the card in and take it out, and allow you to see the front and back easily.\r\n\r\nFor storing cards you don''t want to put in a binder, it''s hard to beat an old Elite Trainer Box. You probably have at least a couple laying around, so it doesn''t cost anything. That''s really all you need.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to get fancy with it, I''d also recommend getting some top-loaders. These are rigid sleeves that you put your card in after you''ve sleeved it with a soft sleeve, like a penny sleeve.\r\n\r\nDeep Pocket Monster also has a great video on the topic of storing cards properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou''re getting into a really amazing hobby, and I''m jealous of you. You get to have the joy of discovering—or rediscovering—all the amazing cards out there! While there''s so much more to be said, I hope this guide can help you as you get started collecting. Ultimately, there is no right or wrong way to collect!','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),'','','images/Screenshot_2024-08-24_at_1.43.06_PM.png','2024-08-24 20:43:43.056104',0,'ff0f6f9deef04fe08e655bf5b5544292');

While it doesn''t have a glaring "1st Edition" stamp on it, the earliest printing of Japanese Base Set does not have the rarity symbol that has become ubiquitous with Pokémon cards.\r\n\r\nWhile it seems like a trivial detail, many serious collectors highly value rarity, and also the first printing of something. And not only is this the first printing of Japanese Base Set, it is the first ever printing of Charizard in the Pokémon TCG. While there were other cards printed featuring Pokémon coming out around that time or even earlier, most notably Topsun, those are not part of the card game legacy that has stood the test of time to this very day.\r\n\r\nAs the first printing of Charizard to feature the iconic Base Set artwork of Mitsuhiro Arita, this card is a part of Pokemon history. While a standard PSA 10 copy of this card is very rare and expensive, with only 8 examples being graded as such, the signature by Mitsuhiro Arita on the case adds even more value.

It''s amazing to see that Charizard already had such a hold on a generation of kids over 20 years ago, and still does to this day.\r\n\r\nThis card is remarkable for a number of reasons. Like its siblings, it was illustrated by Mitsuhiro Arita, the illustrator of the original Base Set Charizard, and the most iconic Pokémon illustrator to this day. Given the number of events and age groups, it is thought that 14 copies of this card exist, making it one of the rarest cards of all time. Of those 14, a total of 4 have been graded by PSA, with this copy being the only one to ever attain a PSA 10.\r\n\r\nBeing the first ever public sale of a Pikachu trophy card, it does give us some insight into the upper echelon of Pokémon cards.

Penny is one of the most interesting characters we''ve seen from a Pokémon game in years, and this card highlights exactly what makes her so compelling: her alter-ego as Cassiopeia, the faceless hacker who both leads Team Star and enlists the player character to disband it. Artist burari has packed this illustration with delightful details that sell Cassiopeia as a leet haxxor, from her split keyboard to the empty drink cans to the random numbers and pie graphs. And then there''s that Sylveon smiling in the background to undercut the mood and remind us that Penny is a huge softie.\r\n\r\nThis card looks like a million bucks, and while it probably won''t be quite that expensive, it''s still going to be the top chase card in Shrouded Fable.','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),'','','images/Screenshot_2024-08-24_at_2.05.21_PM.png','2024-08-24 21:05:31.554531',0,'ff0f6f9deef04fe08e655bf5b5544292');

INSERT INTO blog_post VALUES(105,'74f851388fdd4164a97809e7d495d535','3 Hopes (and 2 Fears) for Pokémon TCG Pocket','',replace(replace('Last weekend at Worlds, The Pokémon Company announced that Pokémon TCG Pocket will release later this year on October 30, 2024.\r\n\r\nFirst teased in February as a collaboration with DeNA, the developer behind Pokémon Masters EX, Pocket has been marketed as a way to replicate the entire experience of collecting and playing with Pokémon cards within a free-to-play mobile app. Players will be able to crack digital packs for digital cards, which they can use to play the Pokémon TCG online against other players. Unlike the existing Pokémon TCG simulator Pokémon TCG Live, Pocket won''t exactly mirror the paper TCG. The cards and sets in Pocket will be exclusive to Pocket (with some card illustrations being reused, and others being completely new), and the gameplay will feature new rules meant to streamline the game for mobile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we still don''t have details about the gameplay rules that will make Pokémon TCG Pocket distinct from the paper TCG, we do have enough information to paint a picture of what''s coming in just a couple of months. That picture should put a smile on the lips of Pokémon TCG fans—and a lump in their throats, because this new app and the existing TCG are basically doomed to compete over similar audiences. Unlike other Pokémon mobile games like GO and UNITE, Pokémon TCG Pocket doesn''t offer fans a new experience, just a lighter, more convenient version of an experience that already exists. And while competition could lead both games to evolve and grow, it''s more likely we''ll see a winner and a loser. All it takes is a look at the impact of MTG Arena on in-person Standard play to see how the growth of one way of playing a game can come at the expense of another.\r\n\r\nLet''s explore those tensions by looking at the opportunities and risks that come with The Pokémon Company''s decision to spin off an alternate mode of their card game. These are my hopes and fears for Pokémon TCG Pocket.\r\n\r\nHope #1 - It Helps More People Enjoy Pokémon\r\nThe Pokémon trading card game is fun!\r\n\r\nI''m sure you''re shocked to see those words published on a site named "TCGplayer," but even if I''m biased, I''m still right. The Pokémon TCG has been delighting players since 1996. If Pokémon TCG Pocket helps more people try the Pokémon TCG, or fit more games into their busy lives, there will be approximately 0.06% more fun in the world. (For reference, that''s enough fun to fill 20 oil tankers stacked end-to-end!) That can only be a good thing.\r\n\r\nAnd there''s every chance that Pocket will do both of those things, just by being a competent reimagining of the TCG for mobile audiences. Pokémon TCG Live, the game''s official online simulator (for international audiences), technically runs on mobile, but it''s been plagued by bugs and eats through batteries like a starving Gulpin. Live also doesn''t do much to soften the edges of the Pokémon TCG that make the game frustrating to newcomers, like the length of the average match, and the fiddly resource management.\r\n\r\nWhile no details about Pocket''s gameplay rules have been confirmed, the tiny clips we''ve seen in the trailers suggest that it''ll play similarly to the My First Battle product. Most notably, games in Pocket are expected to go to three KOs instead of six (with Pokémon ex still being worth more than one KO). That will cut game lengths in half, putting them closer to the length that fans of other modern mobile TCGs like MARVEL SNAP will be comfortable with.\r\n\r\nThe cards we''ve seen also reference an "Energy Zone," which suggests that Energy cards will be replaced with a pool of Energy outside of your deck. That''ll mean one less resource to manage by perfectly sequencing your Trainer cards, which will give players more mental space to anticipate their opponent''s moves. Or to just zone out—an underrated feature of mobile games for many casual players.\r\n\r\nHope #2 - It Nails the Magic of Trading\r\nWhile Pokémon TCG Pocket mostly looks like any other modern digital TCG, one promised feature feels refreshingly retro: the ability to trade cards with other players.\r\n\r\nIf Pocket delivers on this promise, it''ll set the game apart from every other digital card game, most of which drop the "T" from TCG to maintain stricter control of their in-game economy. Trading gives players a way to acquire the cards they want without spending more on in-app purchases. Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, and similar games opt instead for crafting systems that let you "trade" your unwanted cards to the system in exchange for any card you want, while ensuring that the system always gets the better end of the deal. Want one Legendary in Hearthstone? You''ll have to disenchant four Legendaries to get it.\r\n\r\nNot only do crafting systems force unequal trades, but by not implementing peer-to-peer trading, these games lose out on an entire dimension of what makes physical TCGs so fun. Because fans define their own goals in TCGs, mutually beneficial trades are easy to find. Different players want to build different decks, different collectors have different holes in their sets. Trading leads directly to the kinds of feel-good moments and community-building that keeps players invested.\r\n\r\nEven better, trading gives players an avenue for social interaction outside of competition, which fits the vibes that most Pokémon fans are looking for. The main series Pokémon games are all single-player adventures about exploring a utopian world, making friends, and resolving conflicts by progressing dialogue (with some pet battling puzzles in between). The fans who fell in love with those games aren''t looking for an intense 1-v-1 experience where they''re guaranteed to lose ~50% of the time. They want more of that self-directed solo experience, but with the opportunity to give and receive help from other players. Collecting, paired with trading, provides that.\r\n\r\nHope #3 - It Inspires Pokémon to Experiment With the TCG\r\nThe Pokémon TCG is the second-oldest TCG that''s been in print continuously since its first set, and it shows. While the game is still arguably the simplest TCG on the market in terms of its rules—no mean feat, considering the complexity creep that''s plaguing competitors like Magic and Yu-Gi-Oh!—those rules were still written in the same year that Quake released on PC, and reflect that era of game design.\r\n\r\nNeeding 6 KOs to win pushes most games to the 20 to 40-minute range. The delicate balance required between Pokémon, Trainer, and Energy cards makes natural variance extremely punishing, and rewards players who methodically plan every sequencing decision to mitigate that variance as much as possible. And the way KOs award Prize cards can lead to death spirals where the player who''s losing falls ever further behind. Mismanage your resources (or get unlucky), and you can easily wind up powerless to do anything while your opponent wails away on your helpless Pokémon for turn after turn after turn.\r\n\r\nNone of these qualities of the Pokémon TCG are "bad" per se (except maybe death spirals), but they don''t reflect popular tastes in 2024. Compare this to MARVEL SNAP, where every game ends in 6 turns, every card is useful on its own by default, and the player who''s behind can cut their losses at any time. The Pokémon Company has spent decades designing cards to bring their game into the 21st century: multi-Prize Pokémon and Energy acceleration to speed up games, generous search and draw effects to mitigate bad draws, and cards that reward playing from behind. But they''re fighting against inertia that''s baked into the game system.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf DeNA can design a slimmed-down version of the Pokémon TCG that catches on like SNAP, it might prompt The Pokémon Company to be more creative in how it manages the paper TCG. They could introduce a new format with rules that mirror Pocket. They could release a parallel product line of Pokémon cards made for that format. There''s precedent—Yu-Gi-Oh did something similar with Speed Duel and Rush Duel, both of which Konami tried first in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links mobile app, which does for Yu-Gi-Oh! what Pocket promises to do for Pokémon. (Granted, the Speed Duel product line is about to go on indefinite hiatus, but Rush Duel is still going strong in Japan.)\r\n\r\nIn the most extreme case, The Pokémon Company could decide to throw out the old Pokémon TCG rules entirely in favor of the Pocket rules. That would be a huge blow to fans who prefer the current rules, but if Pocket was popular enough, a rules change could end up growing the competitive scene overall. Collectors, whose broad base and deep pockets keep the product line afloat, probably wouldn''t notice or care. Pokémon might be the only TCG on the market that can afford to risk alienating its current player base, so while this is a wild hypothetical, it''s not outside the realm of possibility. And it could be the best outcome in case of Fear #2. Before we get to that though, we have to address another possibility for Pokémon TCG Pocket:\r\n\r\nFear #1 - It Turns Into a Hellscape of Microtransactions\r\nFor all of Pokémon TCG Live''s problems, it deserves credit for being absurdly affordable. There are no in-app purchases at all—practically unheard of for a free-to-download game. You can get cards by entering codes found in physical Pokémon TCG products, which is a nice piece of marketing synergy, but even that isn''t necessary. The in-game currency you earn just by playing with the (remarkably strong) free decks you get at the start of every season are enough to maintain two or three top-tier decks.\r\n\r\nThat probably won''t be the case with Pokémon TCG Pocket. The initial announcement advertised that players will be able to "open two packs per day at no cost," a statement dripping with implications for pack #3 and beyond. Microtransactions are basically inevitable in Pocket. The question is whether these transactions will turn Pocket into a pay-to-win nightmare where you can shortcut the result of every match by comparing bank statements with your opponent to see who has the bigger charge from their mobile app store. If two packs per day aren''t enough to build a decent deck, and additional packs are too expensive, the game won''t be playable except by the biggest whales.\r\n\r\nTrading could mitigate this outcome a bit, but only if the game is well-balanced enough to support multiple decks, especially decks that don''t require the "immersive" cards that collectors are going to be chasing too. If everyone''s playing triple-diamond immersive Mewtwo ex, then a trading system might be even worse than a crafting system at ensuring that players can build the decks they want, because there won''t be any way for players to acquire chase cards—except by buying as many packs as it takes for them to get lucky.\r\n\r\nFear #2 - It Fractures the Player Base\r\nIt would be disappointing if Pokémon TCG Pocket flopped, but it wouldn''t have much impact on the Pokémon franchise as a whole. With DeNA handling the game''s development, a failure probably wouldn''t even slow down any other projects that The Pokémon Company is working on.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario will only unfold if Pocket is a wild success.\r\n\r\nImagine a future where Pocket takes off like Pokémon GO did in the summer of 2016. Everyone and their mother is ripping digital packs and recruiting their friends so they can trade together. The game is quick and engaging enough to compete with SNAP and other light mobile games with mass appeal.\r\n\r\nA game that successful could easily eclipse the paper TCG as the "default" way to play with Pokémon cards. This isn''t scientific exactly, but just compare the player-focused r/pkmntcg subreddit (100 thousand members) to the r/pokemongo subreddit (5 million members), and you can see the reach a free mobile game can have. That could leave the paper TCG starved for new players.\r\n\r\nFor all its faults, Pokémon TCG Live is great at onboarding players to the paper TCG. Not only does it teach players the game and automate all the shuffling, but marketing moves like code cards and the giveaways associated with big in-person tournaments encourage fans of Live to learn about the physical game. And once they do, they''ll find the experience is identical to the one they enjoyed on the app: they can build the exact same deck they''ve been playing on Live and use it to win their locals. The paltry progression rewards of Live and the lack of online tournaments are annoying for digital-only fans, but they''ve kept Live from cannibalizing the physical game (the way that MTG Arena has cannibalized in-person Standard), because only in-person play offers a path to big tournaments and glory.\r\n\r\nPokémon TCG Pocket is different. DeNA has no incentive to funnel players to a physical experience, they''re going to do everything they can to keep their players locked into the app. Any players who do get curious about the paper TCG are going to be confused and frustrated when they learn that they can''t build any of their decks in paper. And if Pocket reaches all those potential players first, the paper TCG will struggle to find new sources of players to draw on.\r\n\r\nThe paper TCG could always move to capitalize on Pocket''s success by adjusting their own rules to better match (or even replicate) the rules of Pokémon TCG Pocket. But if they miss those opportunities, the physical game could slowly dwindle to irrelevance.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this wouldn''t spell the end for physical Pokémon cards. Those will continue selling just fine to collectors, for whom the experience of owning real cards with real-world value can''t be replicated with an app. But as a game, the Pokémon TCG has seen declines before. There''s a real chance that Pokémon TCG Pocket becomes a barrier to the physical game by catching new players and either locking them into the app, or turning off fans who would have preferred the physical game before they get a chance to try it.\r\n\r\nI don''t want to be too alarmist. Pokémon TCG Pocket won''t kill the golden goose that is the Pokémon TCG. But if you squint, it does look interested in harvesting blood from the golden goose to sell its plasma.','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),'','','images/Screenshot_2024-08-24_at_2.09.48_PM.png','2024-08-24 21:10:12.698180',0,'ff0f6f9deef04fe08e655bf5b5544292');
